# EDS Engineering Blog

You can hack on this blog by running:

	bundle install
	bundle exec jekyll serve
	# => Now browse to http://localhost:4000

That will launch the Jekyll builder and server, then
you can edit things and see if they work.

Note: If you change the `_config.yaml` you'll need to
restart Jekyll for those changes to be picked up.
